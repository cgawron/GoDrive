C[[B\] Hello, I am white in this game but comments for black would not hurt :-)
I liked this game a lot, I think that besides my mistakes I found several good moves... or maybe I think so because black did not answer properly.
I would like you to check my questions in the comments, and also give some guidance on the overall style. I also am interested in some border plays, I usually find myself letting the opponent to play in 2nd and 1st lines and answering him automatically because I think those moves are sente... :-(
Also notice my opponent should be 3 stones weaker, but I did not take a lead even when we played with no handicap...
Thanks a lot for your comments and best regards!];B[pd];W[dp]
;B[pp];W[hc]C[[B\] Trying something new... I do not expect this to be a great move!]
;B[dd];W[nc];B[qf];W[pb];B[qc]C[[B\] Probably too passive];W[cf]
;B[ce];W[df];B[fc];W[kd];B[cl]C[[B\] I am quite sure he should have played C9... this point leaves the optimum space for white extension.]
